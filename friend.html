<h1> Some of my lovely friends and neighbors!</h1>
<p>Say hi to my friends and neighbors! Without them, my time in Subang Jaya wouldn't be as interesting as it is right now! Of course, most of them are scattered all around Malaysia, so here are some of the ones I know that live in the area.</p>
<a href="#taylorwen">Yoong Wen</a>|
<a href="#momfriend1">Auntie Teresa</a>|
<a href="#weihan">Lim Wei Han</a>|

<h2><a name="taylorwen">Yoong Wen</a></h2>
<p>As one of my classmates in Sri KL (both in primary and secondary school), Yoong Wen is a friendly fellow who enjoys a multitude of topics. Taylor Swift's music, riding his bicycle as well as photography make up some of his interests. In fact, he was our school's premier photographer, responsible for most of its photos until 2021 (the year we graduated)!</p>

<h2><a name="momfriend1">Aunty Teresa</a></h2>
<p>Aunty Teresa is one of our neighbors and one of the best women I've ever encountered. Owning a large contracting as well as taking a off-hand approach to it has allowed her the funds and time to explore her passions. Trying out new restaurants, traveling around the world as well as collecting art. In fact, there's a series of geodes and paintings around her house, as well as a refurbished balcony, turned into a personal study.</p>

<h2><a name="weihan">Lim Wei Han</a></h2>
<p>Another friend of mine from Sri KL, this maverick of a man is a blast to hang around with. Some of his many talents include hacking, film editing as well as being a general troll. His interests include exploring the outdoors as well as hospital care. In fact, he also has medical training from the Red Cross, so if you're injured, he'll be there to patch you up!</p>
